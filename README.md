# 🐾 Happy Tails Empire 🐾

## Welcome to the whimsical world of virtual pets!

### What is Happy Tails Empire?
Happy Tails Empire is a fun Tamagotchi-style virtual pet game where you can adopt and care for up to four adorable fantasy creatures. Each pet has its own needs and personality, and it's your job to keep them happy, healthy, and thriving!

### Meet the Creatures!
- 🧡 **Jinglebottom** - A bouncy, enthusiastic fuzzy friend
- 💙 **Wobblenose** - A curious and slightly clumsy companion
- 💚 **Bimbleflop** - A laid-back, dreamy little pal
- 💜 **Jollytail** - An energetic, playful buddy

### How to Play
1. Enter a unique name for your pet
2. Choose which type of creature to adopt
3. Click "Create" to welcome your new friend!
4. Take care of your pet by:
   - Giving them naps when their energy is low
   - Feeding them when they're hungry
   - Playing with them when they're bored

### Pet Stats
Each pet has three vital stats that you need to monitor:
- **Energy** 🔋 - Keep this up by having your pet take naps
- **Fullness** 🍽️ - Feed your pet to maintain this stat
- **Happiness** 😊 - Play with your pet to keep them happy

### Watch Out!
If any of your pet's stats reach zero, they won't survive! The more pets you have, the more challenging it becomes to keep everyone happy.

### Developer Notes
This game was created using:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3/SCSS for styling

No external libraries or frameworks were used - just pure coding fun!
